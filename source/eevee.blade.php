I am Darksim905's ex. And apparently I have to do this.<br>

Darksim is a predator, abuser, and a monster, plain and simple.

<br>
He stalked and harassed women and femmes in tech and infosec while we were together.

<br>
He lied to me, a lot. Like, a lot a lot. He lied to me about victim's stories. He lied to me about continuing to harass [redacted].
<br>
He's a monster.
<br>

<br>
He kept me from his friends by talking shit about them. He inserted himself into my friend group and attempted to socially isolate me by doing so. A close friend (who he was insanely jealous of) pointed this out to me after the fact. Multiple friends wanted to tell me sooner, but could not for fear of my physical safety. Darksim is a monster.

<br>
At derby, he saw me off at the airport, then sat down at a dinner with [redacted] and a few mutual friends. He told me he was done with [redacted], yet he sat down at dinner...uninvited. He talked shit about [redacted] whom he told me he was done with, to the friends. It was uncomfortable for everyone. Darksim is a monster.

<br>
He attempted to socially isolate me. He attempted to groom me. He hurts people. He stalks and harasses women and femmes in tech. He's a fucking monster. I hate I have to say this, but here we are.

<br>
He locked in an attempt to rebrand. Nothing more. Life ain't an anime, and not everyone gets a redemption arc. He is someone undeserving of a redemption arc. He's hurt so many people.
